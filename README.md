# Design_And_Implementation_Of_RDMS
Database Management System is developed using C++. 
The system allow us to do various DDL and DML operations including Create, Drop, Truncate, 
Describe, Insert, Delete, Update, Select, Help (includes help table- give name of all tables in 
database and help cmd where cmd is one of the data definition and manipulation commands listed above.)
Schema is represented in Schema.txt file to store the database schema. For each relation, the file schema has a line
beginning with that relation name, in which attribute names alternate with types. The character # separates elements of these lines. 
A schema can contain more dynamic information such as number of tuples in the relation.
When tables are created separate text file named as respective table name will be created and records 
will be get insert into it and further we can perform other operations also.
